        <h1>&#9752; How is the weather forecast made?</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Weather forecasting</strong> starts with observing the
            current state of the atmosphere. Knowing its current condition,
            forecasters can then predict upcoming weather changes in the coming
            days or weeks. “We live in an ocean of air, all weather changes
            depend on solar radiation. The state of the air ocean speaks more
            about future weather than about the weather at the moment, ”wrote
            Robert Fitzroy, founder and head of the British Meteorological
            Department, the future Met Office, in the introduction to his
            Weather Book. The first ever published weather forecast was compiled
            by Robert Fitzroy. It was published in the English newspaper The
            Times on August 1, 1861. According to one version, it was the
            inaccuracy of his forecasts that became the reason for his voluntary
            death. Numerous weather sensors on and above the Earth, at sea and
            in orbit measure a range of weather parameters that help paint the
            most complete picture of the weather on our planet. Weather
            information is collected by meteorological organizations around the
            globe, and then national weather services share it with their
            counterparts in other countries. The main weather parameters
            include: temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed and
            direction, precipitation and their amount. To measure them on land,
            a network of meteorological stations operates. There are 1670 such
            weather stations in Russia, while, for example, in China there are
            more than 53 thousand of them. They can be operated by
            meteorologists or be fully automated. In the United States, for
            example, there is a network of automated observation systems (ASOS)
            for the surface. Such weather stations are installed in more than
            900 airports throughout the country, where they collect information
            about weather phenomena.

        <h2>Weather forecasting methods</h2>
        <p>
            Weather prediction is considered to be the ultimate goal of
            atmospheric research. Forecasting is noted
            <strong>as the most developed</strong>
            area in meteorology. The nature of modern weather forecasting is
            quite complex. It is customary to distinguish three methods of
            scientific weather forecasting: synoptic weather forecasting,
            numerical (aka hydrodynamic) method, and statistical.
